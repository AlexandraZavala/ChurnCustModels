## Description
This project focuses on churn customer detection using machine learning techniques and web application development. Below are the main stages of the project:

## What I Did:

🧹 **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Cleaned and engineered features to ensure high-quality input data for model training.

🤖 **Model Training**: Tuned multiple models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, as well as ensemble methods like Voting Classifier and Stacking Classifier, focusing on optimizing recall.

🌐 **API Deployment**: Hosted the models on Render, making them accessible via an API for easy integration.

🖥️ **Web App Development**: Built a dashboard with Streamlit to visualize customer data, model predictions, and automated AI-generated explanations, along with personalized retention emails.

🔗 **Llama 3.1 Integration**: Integrated Llama 3.1 using Groq to enhance the generation of predictive explanations and email content.
